Dateset and R Code for the analysis of an experiment using simplified grassland communities with forbs and grasses to evaluate the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their diversity on plant biomass production. Plant communities differed in the proportion of grasses to also assess the mediation of plant functional composition on AMF effects.
