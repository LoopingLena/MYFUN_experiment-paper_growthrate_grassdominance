R Code for the analysis of an experiment using simplified grassland communities with forbs and grasses to evaluate the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their diversity on plant biomass production. Plant communities differed in the proportion of grasses to also assess the mediation of plant functional composition on AMF effects.  

To start, open the R scripts and follow the comments there step by step. 

Script1 refers to preparatory analysis to estimate seedling biomass at the beginning of the experiment: "biomassa_allometrias_without_outliers.R"

Script2 refers to the data analysis of growth rates over the course of the experiment, growth rate estimates being based also on seedling biomass: "experiment_data_analysis_publication.R". 

References datasets have integrated the estimates of script 1 already and are ready to be run. 

The datasets used in the code and associated meta data are available as csv. format in the zenodo project, with DOI = 10.5281/zenodo.17616471.
